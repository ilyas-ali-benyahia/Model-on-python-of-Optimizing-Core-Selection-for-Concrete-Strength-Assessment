"We developed a model using Python to analyze concrete strength assessment through non-destructive testing (NDT) combined with limited destructive coring (DT) in structural elements. This project investigates the effectiveness of conditional coring in enhancing the calibration of strength estimation models, utilizing data from Rebound Hammer and Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity tests. Our methodology addresses the challenges in achieving reliable conversion models when the number of cores is limited."
